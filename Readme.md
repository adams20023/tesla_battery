# Tesla Battery Range Optimization Prototype

## Overview
This project simulates the current performance of a Tesla car battery (440-mile range) and models improvements to achieve an 800-mile range. The goal is to demonstrate how advancements in battery capacity, energy efficiency, and 
driving behavior can extend the range of electric vehicles.

## Current Tesla Battery
The current Tesla Model S Long Range has the following specifications:
- **Battery Capacity**: 100 kWh
- **Energy Consumption**: 0.227 kWh/mile
- **Range**: ~440 miles
- **Driving Conditions**:
  - Speed: 50–80 mph
  - Temperature: -10°C to 40°C
  - Terrain: Flat and hilly

While this range is impressive, there is room for improvement to meet the growing demand for longer-range electric vehicles.

## Proposed Improvements
To achieve an 800-mile range, we propose the following improvements:
1. **Increased Battery Capacity**: From 100 kWh to 180 kWh.
   - This involves advancements in battery technology, such as higher energy-density cells or more efficient battery packs.
2. **Reduced Energy Consumption**: From 0.227 kWh/mile to 0.125 kWh/mile.
   - Achieved through:
     - Aerodynamic design improvements.
     - Optimized motor efficiency.
     - Regenerative braking enhancements.
3. **Optimized Driving Behavior**:
   - Speed: Reduced from 50–80 mph to 40–60 mph for better efficiency.
   - Temperature: Maintained between 10°C and 30°C to minimize thermal losses.
   - Terrain: Limited to flat terrain to reduce energy consumption.

These improvements result in a theoretical range of ~800 miles.
